# Welcome to the Ecosystem Stability Working Group! 

This README will help you get started.



# **About Us**

We are an interdisciplinary group of scientists, students, and postdocs focused on understanding the impacts of climate change on ecosystem stability. Below you will find a summary of current projects and their associated repositories.

The Ecosystem Stability Working Group is an oganization on GitHub managed by the PIs of the working group. The organization includes different teams that are working on subprojects.

# **How to Collaborate**

Step 1: Create a GitHub personal account (https://github.com/)

Step 2: Request access to the working group organization (email: dudney@ucsb.edu or any PI)

Step 3: If your subgroup is working within a team, also request team access so you can clone the right repositories

Step 4: Clone the repositories associated with your team(s).


# **Six Best Practices for Collaborative Coding**

1. Avoid coding within the same script at the same time to reduce the # of conflicts
   
2. Always pull before you push to avoid conflicts

3. Keep code up to date on the main branch (push and pull often so others can see progress)

4. More is better when it comes to documenting your code!
   
5. If a conflict emerges, work with your team to resolve the conflict to avoid losing important code

6. Be patient with yourself and others — collaborative coding is challenging but worth it!
